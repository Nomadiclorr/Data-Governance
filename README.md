# Data-Governance
A detailed background of data governance and why it’s important in a world of increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data.


# Defining Data Governance
Data governance is a collection of processes, policies, roles, metrics, and standards that ensure an effective and efficient use of information. It encompasses the people, processes, and information technology required to create a consistent and proper handling of an organization's data across the business enterprise. Data governance promotes the availability, quality, and security of an organization’s data through different policies and standards. These processes determine data owners, data security measures, and intended uses for the data.

The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

### Data Governance Versus Data Management
Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

### Data Governance versus Information Governance
Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning.
Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

### The Value of Data Governance
- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search
- Reduced risks from data-related issues
- Reduced data management costs
- Established rules for handling data

## Creating a Data Governance Program
1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
4. Achieving leadership approval.
5. Designing and developing the program.
6. Implementing the program.
7. Monitoring and measuring performance.
8. Maintaining the program.

## Developing a Data Governance Framework

#### Leadership and Strategy
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail. When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership. Without full support from your organization’s leaders, your data governance efforts won’t succeed.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
A data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.
While specific roles do exist, organizations must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone.

#### Policies, Processes, and Standards
Policies, processes, and standards guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

#### Metrics
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program. Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

#### Tools
A large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. 

#### Communications and Collaboration
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.


## Preparing for Data Governance
Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists.
There are other prerequisites for data governance success. These include ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

#### What is data culture?
Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right. Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success. Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time. Imagine for a moment designing and deploying a data governance program for an organization that has little or no data culture. Every organization has some form of a data culture; it just might not be in an ideal state.

#### Assessing the Data Culture
Data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture). Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work. Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions.

## Maturing the Data Culture
- Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
- Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
- Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
- Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

#### Assessing Data Governance Readiness

**The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:**

- The basis of a data culture exists.
- The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
- Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
- Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
- One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
- The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
- The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
- You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
- Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
- Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
- The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.
