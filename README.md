# Data-Governance
A detailed background of data governance and why it’s important in a world of increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data.


# Defining Data Governance
Data governance is a collection of processes, policies, roles, metrics, and standards that ensure an effective and efficient use of information. It encompasses the people, processes, and information technology required to create a consistent and proper handling of an organization's data across the business enterprise. Data governance promotes the availability, quality, and security of an organization’s data through different policies and standards. These processes determine data owners, data security measures, and intended uses for the data.

The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

### Data Governance Versus Data Management
Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

### Data Governance versus Information Governance
Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning.
Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

### The Value of Data Governance
- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search
- Reduced risks from data-related issues
- Reduced data management costs
- Established rules for handling data

## Creating a Data Governance Program
1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
4. Achieving leadership approval.
5. Designing and developing the program.
6. Implementing the program.
7. Monitoring and measuring performance.
8. Maintaining the program.

**Common elements of Data Governance**

## Developing a Data Governance Framework

#### Leadership and Strategy
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail. When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership. Without full support from your organization’s leaders, your data governance efforts won’t succeed.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
A data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.
While specific roles do exist, organizations must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone.

#### Policies, Processes, and Standards
Policies, processes, and standards guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

#### Metrics
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program. Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

#### Tools
A large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. 

#### Communications and Collaboration
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.


## Preparing for Data Governance
Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists.
There are other prerequisites for data governance success. These include ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program.

#### What is data culture?
Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right. Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success. Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time. Imagine for a moment designing and deploying a data governance program for an organization that has little or no data culture. Every organization has some form of a data culture; it just might not be in an ideal state.

#### Assessing the Data Culture
Data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture). Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work. Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions.

## Maturing the Data Culture
- Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
- Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
- Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
- Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

#### Assessing Data Governance Readiness

**The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:**

- The basis of a data culture exists.
- The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
- Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
- Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
- One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
- The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
- The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
- You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
- Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
- Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
- The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.


# Exploring a World Overflowing with Data
## Defining Data
Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as *datum* and multiple units as data. 

**Data Format Categories**
- Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
- Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
- Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

  ## From Data to Insight
  Creating, collecting, and storing data is a waste of time and money if it’s being done without a clear purpose or intent to use it in the future.
  Information is data in context.

  **The Differences Between Data and Information**
  ![Infovdata](https://github.com/Nomadiclorr/Data-Governance/assets/138734847/79d188fc-ad4e-4214-b97d-ddbe5d4b8fd3)

  ## The Role of Data in the 21st Century
  Since the early days of data processing in the 19th and 20th centuries right through to digital transformation in the 21st century, data has played many important roles. It’s helped us understand the world in completely new ways, improved our ability to make better-informed decisions, and supported our efforts to solve all manner of problems. In this way, it’s fair to say that data has always been important.

  ## Data-Driven Decision-Making
  The greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions.

  ## Data Ownership
  For something to be properly managed, someone needs to be responsible. We create accountability in job descriptions and projects.

  ### Data ownership
  Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.

  ## Data Architecture
  When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA). Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.

  A subset of EA is **data architecture**. In the same manner, which you can consider the holistic nature of EA in support of the organization’s strategy, data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business. Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.

**At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:**
- Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
- Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
- Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
- Adopting and agreeing to data standards
- Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication

 ## The Lifecycle of Data

 ![lc](https://github.com/Nomadiclorr/Data-Governance/assets/138734847/0d43e093-6064-4710-a44f-ff8b3074d41f)

**1. Creation:**  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
**2. Storage:**  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
**3. Usage:**  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
**4. Archival:**  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
**5. Destruction:**  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

## Defining Big Data
Big data is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques.

**One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:**

1. Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
2. Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
3. Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
4. Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
5. Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

# Driving Value Through Data
## Identifying the Roles of Data

### Operations
Operations run on and are powered by a variety of data and information sources. They also create a lot of both, too.
Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization. Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements. Some core functions show up in almost every organization. Consider payroll, order management, and marketing. At the same time, some operational support won’t be required. Not every organization needs its own IT organization, or if it’s a service business, it may not have a warehouse.

### Strategy
Every organization has a strategy, whether it’s articulated overtly or not. At the organizational level, this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals. It’s essentially about understanding the challenges to delivering on the organization’s purpose and then agreeing on the proposed solutions to those challenges. Strategy can also be adopted at the department and division levels, but the intent is the same: understand the journey ahead and make a plan.

### Decision-Making
It’s generally accepted in business that the highest form of value derived from data is the ability to make better-informed decisions. The volume and quality of data available today have no precedent in history.
Within organizations, access to abundant data and information has resulted in quicker, timeous, and better-quality business decisions. For example, executives can understand their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats closer to real time. For most, gone are the days of waiting until the end of the fiscal quarter to get the good or bad news. Even if the information is tentative in the interim, it’s vastly better than being in the dark until it may be too late.

### Measuring
Organizations are in a continuous state of measurement, whether it’s overt or tacit. Every observed unit of data contributes to building a picture of the business.
Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language.
The type of information desired directly correlates to the measurement approach. This is going to inform your choices of at least what, when, where, and how data is captured. A general rule is only to capture and measure what matters. Some may argue that capturing data now to measure later has value even if there isn’t a good case yet. I can buy that but be careful with your limited resources and the potential costs.

### Monitoring
This is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of, say, a project, process, system, or another item of interest. Often the results collected are compared against some existing values or desired targets. For example, a machine on a factory floor may be expected to produce 100 widgets per hour. You engage in some manner of monitoring in order to inform whether, in fact, this expectation is being met. Across a wide range of activities, monitoring also helps to ensure the continuity, stability, and reliability of that being supervised.
Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. It’s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring. For example, the deviation from the expected result.
By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner. Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized.

### Insight Management
Data forms the building blocks of many business functions. In support of decision-making — arguably its most important value — data is the source for almost all insight. As a basic definition, business insight is sometimes referred to as information that can make a difference.
It’s not enough to simply collect lots of data and expect that insight will suddenly emerge. There must be an attendant management process. Thus, insight management means ensuring that data and information are capable of delivering insight.

### Reporting
Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of data and information management in any organization is the use of reports. Creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on reports are fundamental functions of any organization. Some say they are the backbone of every business. That sounds overly glamorous, but it does speak to the importance of reporting and reports.

The content of a report, which can be summarized or detailed, contains data and information in a structured manner. For example, an expenditure report would provide a basic overview of the purpose of the report and then support it with relevant information. That could include a list of all expenditures for a department over a certain period or it could just be a total amount. It will depend on the audience and purpose. The inclusion of visuals is popular.

### Other Roles for Data
While we’ve gone over a number of the most visible uses of data in organizations today, it was not the intent to list every conceivable way that data is used. That said, here’s a short list of some other important areas that we should not omit.

- Artificial intelligence (AI):  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve. It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities. In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations.
- Problem-solving:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution to use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.
- Data reuse:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons. Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance). For example, the sales team in an organization will collect your name and address in order to fulfill an order. Later, that same data set may be used by the marketing team to create awareness about other products and services. These are two different teams with different goals using the same data. Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules. (Note: High-value shared data sets are called master data, and in data governance, they are subject to master data management.)


## Approaching Data as an Asset
An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit. This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.

An asset can be tangible or intangible. Tangible assets are physical things such as inventory, machines, and property. That’s stuff you can see and touch. An intangible asset is the opposite; it’s a non-physical thing like software, copyrights, a brand, and goodwill. Data is an intangible asset.

**Examples of the economic value of data:**

- Improves operations.
- Increases existing revenue.
- Produces new forms of revenue.
- Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
- Improves the quality of products and services.
- Contributes to competitive advantage.
- Enables innovation.
- Reduces risk.

 ## Data Analytics
 The process of examining data in order to produce answers or find conclusions is called data analytics. A formal and disciplined approach is conducted by a data analyst, and it’s a necessary step for any individual or organization that’s trying to make good decisions for their organization.

 **The basic Data Analytics Process**

 ![da](https://github.com/Nomadiclorr/Data-Governance/assets/138734847/39bbeca9-1088-4ba3-be0e-fdafeab1f6c2)

### Data analytics has four primary types. 

**1. Descriptive:**  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.
**2. Diagnostic:**  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.
**3. Predictive:**  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.
**4. Prescriptive:**  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes.

![ty](https://github.com/Nomadiclorr/Data-Governance/assets/138734847/dc980a8d-d54f-413d-a0a4-a98181c4ace7)

Data analytics involves the use of a variety of software tools depending on the needs, complexities, and skills of the analyst. Beyond your favorite spreadsheet program, which can deliver a lot of capabilities, data analysts use products such as R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, QlikView, and others.

## Data Management
Data management is not the same as data governance! But they work closely together to deliver results in the use of enterprise data.
**Data governance** concerns itself with, for example, defining the roles, policies, controls, and processes for increasing the quality and value of organizational data.
**Data management** is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking. To get value from data, there must be execution.

Data management processes involve the collection, storage, organization, maintenance, and analytics of an organization’s data. It includes the architecture of technology systems such that data can flow across the enterprise and be accessed whenever and by whom it is approved for use. Additionally, responsibilities will likely include such areas as data standardization, encryption, and archiving.

### Governing Data
Governing data means that some level of control exists to support a related policy. For example, an organization may decide that to reduce risk, there needs to be a policy that requires data to be backed up every day. The control would be the documentation of the process and enforcement of that policy. If, in the review of policy adherence, data wasn’t getting backed up, then you’d quickly know that governance, for whatever reason, was not working.

**The success of governing data can be reduced to three essential factors:**
**- People:**  While recognizing that data is increasingly created and used exclusively by machines without human intervention, handling and benefiting from data is still a highly people-centric exercise. Even in a machine-centric context, it’s people who are most often defining, designing, and maintaining data use. In governing data, people are the subject matter experts, they are responsible for quality, and they oversee and manage all related processes and responsibilities.
**- Policies:**  A data policy contains a set of adopted rules by an organization that apply to the handling of data in specific conditions and for particular desired outcomes. These policies apply in areas such as quality, privacy, retention, and security. The number of policies is typically a reflection of the size of the organization, the industry, and the degree to which data is considered a high-priority asset. As you can imagine, the healthcare and financial industries, for example, which manage high volumes of sensitive data, have a significant number of data policies in support of their data governance programs.
**- Metrics:**  It’s largely true, what gets measured gets managed. In developing policies in support of data governance, you have to consider how each is measured. For example, if a policy states that there shouldn’t be more than five risk events per month such as a regulatory requirement being out of compliance, then, assuming the metric is high to begin with, it should decrease over time. If it doesn’t decrease or it does and then fluctuates widely, there’s an issue with the relevant data management procedures. Metrics must be in support of both technical and business needs. 

# Transforming Through Data
## Examining the Broader Value of Data
In small organizations or when a business is first created, only a few systems are used, and team members know the type and location of most of the data that is available. You can imagine, for example, basic repositories for customer data, invoices, and marketing materials.
The ability of team members to access data that they need for their work, without having to rely on specialists, is called **data democratization.**

Unfortunately, over time, the situation often deteriorates. Whether because of culture, strategy (or lack of strategy), systems design, budgets, mergers, or any number of other dynamics, data sets get siloed. A **data silo** is a data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not frequently shared or known by other parts of the business. Data silos hinder business efficiencies because they reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies. In addition, they are a source of risk, including security and regulatory issues.

**Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:**

- Better informed decision-making.
- Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
- Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
- Improved data analytics and reporting.
- Higher performing systems.
- More efficient operations.
- Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.
