# Data-Governance
A detailed background of data governance and why it’s important in a world of increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data.


## Understanding Data Governance
Data governance is a collection of processes, policies, roles, metrics, and standards that ensure an effective and efficient use of information. It encompasses the people, processes, and information technology required to create a consistent and proper handling of an organization's data across the business enterprise. Data governance promotes the availability, quality, and security of an organization’s data through different policies and standards. These processes determine data owners, data security measures, and intended uses for the data.

The discipline in which an organization acts in recognition of the value of its information assets (a fancy term for data with specific value to an organization, such as a customer or product record) is called enterprise information management (EIM). Governing and managing data well is a central enabler of EIM, which also includes using technologies and processes to elevate data to be a shared enterprise asset.

### Data Governance Versus Data Management
Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

### Data Governance versus Information Governance
Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning.
Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.
